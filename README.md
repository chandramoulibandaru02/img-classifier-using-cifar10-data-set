ðŸ§  Image Classification using ANN
A simple image classification project using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. This project demonstrates how to preprocess image data, train a neural network model, evaluate its performance, and visualize predictions.
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
           Python
           TensorFlow / Keras
           NumPy
           Matplotlib
           Seaborn
           scikit-learn

 ðŸ§ª Model Workflow
 Load and preprocess image data (e.g., MNIST or Fashion MNIST)
 Normalize the pixel values
 Define a Sequential ANN model
 Compile with loss, optimizer, and metrics
 Train using model.fit()
 Predict classes using model.predict()
 Evaluate using:
 Accuracy
 Classification Report
 Confusion Matrix
 Visualize correct and incorrect predictions
 Save the model for future use
 ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
 Accuracy â€“ Overall prediction correctness
 Precision & Recall â€“ Per-class quality analysis
 F1-Score â€“ Balanced performance score
 Confusion Matrix â€“ Class-wise result breakdown
 Future Enhancements
  Upgrade to CNN for better accuracy
  Use image data augmentation
  Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
  Enable real-time image upload and classification
